## Database of Putative RNA G4 Sequences in pre-miRNAs (miRBase v.21) of Human and Other Species ##

The data listing putative rG4 sequences contained in different pre-miRNAs from different species (miRBase v.21), along with the identification information for the source pre-miRNA and rG4 positions, are contained in the 1_pre-miRNA-G4s file. General statistics on the putative rG4 occurrence in different species are contained in the 2_organism_stat file. The datasets are brought in both comma-separated CSV and Excel formats (same file names with .csv and .xlsx extensions).
